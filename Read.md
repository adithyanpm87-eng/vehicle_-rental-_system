## Problem Statement
Manual parking slot allocation often leads to confusion, time wastage, and inefficient space usage. This project provides an automated solution to book parking slots easily using a graphical user interface.

## Objective
To develop a Java-based Parking Slot Booking System that demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- GUI development using Java Swing
- Exception handling
- Multithreading
- (Optional) JDBC extensibility

## Features
- User-friendly GUI using Java Swing
- Parking slot booking for Car and Bike
- Displays booking status (Available / Booked)
- Input validation with meaningful error messages
- Background processing using multithreading
- Clean and modular OOP-based design

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Abstraction:** Abstract class `ParkingSlot`
- **Inheritance:** `CarSlot`, `BikeSlot`
- **Polymorphism:** Overridden methods like `getSlotType()`
- **Encapsulation:** Controlled access to slot status

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing
- Multithreading
- Exception Handling
- IDE: NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA
